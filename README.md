formura
=======


Formura = Formula Translator - Translator + Muranushi

In Formura, you can describe stencil computations just as if you would write the discretized formulae in the papers, without even translating them into Fotran.

The syntax of Formura is kept simple, so that you can easily learn and write simple Formura programs, and you can generate more complex Formura programs from your favorite programming languages.
